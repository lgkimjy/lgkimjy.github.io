### Introduction

### Purpose of Research

### Proposed Methods
* Particle filter-based lcalization
* Landmark extraction using CNN-based Object Detection Model.
* Enhancing Data Association method using Hungarian algorithm.


### Simulation
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/humanoid_localization/scene1_4_result(0.234m).png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/humanoid_localization/scene4_7_result(0.213m).png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    The Localization results in a simulated environment. The <b>estimated position</b> of the robot is shown in <b><font color='BFBF00'>yellow</font></b> on the field image, which follows <b><font color='blue'>blue</font></b>(<b>ground truth</b>) well, in contrast to the <b><font color='red'>red</font></b>, which represents the <b>kinematically accumulated position</b>.

### Real-World Experiments
You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
