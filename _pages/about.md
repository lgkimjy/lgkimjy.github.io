I am a Ph.D. stduent in the <font color='CC0000'>Hybrid Intelligent Experimental Robotics Lab</font> at the North Carolina State University advised by Prof. [Jaemin Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=40GgSzwAAAAJ&hl=ko). My current research focuses on humanoid whole-body loco-manipulation, with the goal of developing fully autonomous and generalized humanoid robots capable of assisting humans in real-world tasks.

Prior to joining NCSU, I worked as a research scientist at the <font color='ff7e55'>Humanoid Robotics Lab.</font> at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), under the supervision of Dr. [Yonghwan Oh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hEnok94AAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao). There, I contributed to the development of wheeled-legged humanoid robots, with a particular emphasis on improving mobility through dynamic walking and driving capabilities.

I earned my Master's degree in 2022 from Hanyang University, guided by Prof. [JeaKweon Han](https://sites.google.com/site/heroehslab/home?authuser=0). I also completed my Bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering at Hanyang University ERICA Campus in 2020.

<!-- I am interested in legged robots, particularly in humanoid robots' whole-body control and dynamic locomotion planning. 

I'm currently a full-time research intern at the <font color='ff7e55'>Humanoid Robotics Lab.</font> at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), working under Dr. [Yonghwan Oh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hEnok94AAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao). My current research is centered on the control and locomotion of wheel-legged humanoid robots. The aim is to develop robots that not only mimic human movement but also adapt to various terrains and situations, thereby expanding their utility in real-world applications.

I earned my Master's Degree in 2022 from Hanyang University, under guidance by Prof. [JeaKweon Han](https://sites.google.com/site/heroehslab/home?authuser=0). Before that, I completed my B.S. in Robotics at Hanyang University ERICA in 2020. -->



<!-- I have always been captivated by the potential of humanoid robots, particularly in the realms of control and dynamic locomotion. My journey in this fascinating field began at Hanyang University ERICA, where I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees. During my Master's program, I was fortunate to be guided by Prof. JeaKweon Han, and my research was primarily focused on humanoid perception.

After completing my academic journey at Hanyang University, I joined the Humanoid Robotics Lab at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in 2023. Here, I serve as a research intern under the mentorship of Dr. Oh YongHwan. My current research is centered on the control and locomotion of wheel-legged humanoid robots. The aim is to develop robots that not only mimic human movement but also adapt to various terrains and situations, thereby expanding their utility in real-world applications.

The work I am engaged in is not just about creating robots that move; it's about understanding the intricate dance between control mechanisms and dynamic motion. I am committed to pushing the boundaries of what humanoid robots can achieve, ensuring they can be both versatile and reliable companions for humans. -->
